"""The merge line (#400 decision 2): `run_line` lands a repo's green pull requests on its base one by
one, the oldest ready first, under the repo's line lock, run on the machine under the owner's `gh`
(so every update and merge starts the required checks).

A member of the line is an open, non-draft pull request into the base, its head in this repo (no
fork), with a ready mark that no left mark followed; its ready time is its ready mark's. The line is the
only one that merges in the line's order (#414); the follow's mark-only path (#424) merges a pull request
that has no line. One run, until the line is empty or `line_minutes` pass:

1. every conflicting member leaves the line at once and its ticket goes back to ready with the
   files (the follow's conflict rule), so a conflict never holds the members behind it;
2. the head is the oldest ready member;
3. the head is served: behind -> brought up to date (`update_branch`, at most `max_updates` times a
   run, else it waits for the next run: `starved`); a conflict on the update -> the conflict rule;
   then its required checks of the head sha are waited for, polling every `poll_seconds`, at most
   `check_minutes` (`bound`: it stays in the line for the next run, the next member goes), with the
   follow run at each poll (a person's comment, an edit of its ticket, a red, no result: the follow
   moves the ticket and the head `left`); green and up to date -> its title and body are read fresh,
   and a closing keyword in either refuses it (`refused`: a left mark with the reason, nothing merged,
   the line goes on); else the line merges it itself with its head sha and the setting `merge_method`,
   and the follow closes its ticket at once (GitHub refusing the merge more than `max_updates` times:
   `refused`, left for the next run). A head that moved since the checks were read is refused by GitHub
   (the merge is pinned to the sha), so a pull request never lands on a tree whose checks were not read.

With the setting `batch_size` over 1 and a `suite` given (#414 item 5), steps 2 and 3 are one pass for up to
`batch_size` members instead of one pass each: the oldest ready members are combined on one branch from the base (each
head merged in line order; a member that does not combine with the ones before it is left apart and goes in a batch of
its own after), the required suite runs once on that tree through the place rule. The pass replaces no required check:
the combined tree is a branch, and the line waits (every `poll_seconds`, at most `check_minutes`, by the clock) until
every name of `required_checks` is green on that exact sha, whichever place posted it; only then does it move the base
forward to the tested commit by one non-forced ref update (the base's sha is the tested tree's, each pull request ends
merged), which the base's own protection accepts or refuses and the line never pushes around.
A suite that passed at a place other than GitHub (whatever the cause: Actions off, minutes spent, a queue past its
bound, a private repo with nothing protected, or simply the place rule choosing a machine) speaks for the required names
its run covered (the test jobs on its OS and the names tied to no OS): the line posts PASSED for each of those nobody
posted on the sha. A name it did not cover (a test job of another OS, a name the workflow cannot place) stays unposted
and holds the batch, as does any name nobody posted. A suite that passed at GitHub posts nothing of its own (GitHub posts
its check runs), nor does a failed one, nor the rerun of placeholder tests (a subset of the suite). A base's protection
counts a commit status of a required name on a ref update and does not count the check runs of a manual (dispatch) run on a
batch branch: so right before the landing the line posts PASSED too for each required name it saw green only as a check run
(`post_counted`); a post GitHub does not take holds the batch like a name not green (the note names the error code).
A repo whose base protects nothing is held by this same wait and refusal: the line alone holds the required checks. A
name still not green when the wait ends (note `required checks not green on <sha>: <names>`) lands nothing and stops
the run: every member not landed stays for the next run.
A red test or a red required name splits the batch in halves, each half is combined again from the base as it then is
and checked, down to the one red pull request, which goes back to its ticket by the follow's red rule while the others
land. A red whose every
failing test also fails on main (an open red-on-main ticket covers them, and a run of those ids alone on the sha main had
when the batch was made fails them all) is not a member's fault: the line stops there (note `main is red on <ids>`), the
members stay for the next run, none is sent back. A base that moved under a green pass rebuilds the batch on the new
base (without the members that left it), at most `max_updates` times. A landing counts as merged only when GitHub says
the pull request is merged (polled up to a minute; else `bound`, detail `landed_pending`, for the next run). A base whose
protection refuses the landing (note `batch landing refused: <why>`) sends the rest of the run one by one. A line that
batches first deletes the `orch-batch/` branches older than `lock_stale_minutes`. `batch_size` 1, or no suite, is the
one-by-one line above.

Before each ask of the place rule for a run (the batch's pass, the run of a failing test's ids on main) the line asks its
`priority_hold` (#414 item 4, `testruns/priority.py`): while it names a repo of the account with a higher
`github_priority` that has a ready member and the account's jobs are at their concurrency, the line waits (every
`poll_seconds`) and asks again; held to the run's bound, nothing starts, every member stays for the next run (note
`start held for <repo>`, detail `priority_hold`).

Events: a `line` step, run `line:<repo>@<start>` (started `base`, `prs`; ended `merged`, `left`,
reason `empty`, `next_run` or `bound`; `failed` with `error` when the run breaks; `refused` with
`lock_busy`/`lock_stale` when the lock is not had) and one `line.served` per turn under that run
(`pr`, `result`, `followed`, `waited_minutes`, `updates`), plus `pr.updated` per update.
