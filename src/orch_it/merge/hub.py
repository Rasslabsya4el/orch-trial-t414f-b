"""What the merge flow needs of GitHub (#400), in its own terms: the one `gh` seam.

`PullHub` is the tickets' `Hub` (#398) plus pull requests, their check runs on one head sha, their
notes, the runs of the `tests` workflow and the issues of red main. `GhPullHub` answers it through
`gh` for a real repo; the tests answer it from memory (`tests/fake_github.py`). As in the `Hub`, a
call that fails raises `orch_it.testruns.github.GithubError` and a thing that is not there is
`None`, never an error.

Every check result is read for one head sha (`checks`): a run of an older head is never read as
the result of the newer one (MERGE-12).
