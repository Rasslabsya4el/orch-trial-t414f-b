"""The suite the merge line runs on a batch (#414 item 5): one required test run on one commit, placed by the place rule.

`place_rule_suite` is that run: it checks the commit out into a folder of its own, hands the folder to `run_tests` (so the
run is a `test_run` in the store, at the place the rule picks, and the passes of a line are those runs) and answers what
the line needs, `passed`, `failed` with the ids of the failing tests, or `no_result`. A run that was refused, lost,
cut or wrote no readable report is `no_result`, never `failed`. `git_checkout` is the checkout for a real repo: the
commit is fetched from `origin` into the work tree and made a detached work tree of its own, removed after the run.
