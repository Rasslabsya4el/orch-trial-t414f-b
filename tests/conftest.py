"""Shared test setup (#421 rule 2): no test reads or writes the real per-user settings file or data folder.

Every test gets ORCH_IT_SETTINGS set, through monkeypatch, to a settings file in a folder of its own under pytest's
temporary base. A test that sets the variable itself runs later and its own monkeypatch value wins.

The language (#453 unit 1) is read from the `settings.json` at the root of the cwd's git work tree. The cwd of every
test is a folder of its own that is no git tree (GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES stops the lookup at the test's base), so the
suite's language is English unless a test writes its own tree file.
